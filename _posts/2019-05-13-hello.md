Welcome to for science, where our motto is "try it and see". That's because to
forscience something is to try it and see what happens. This is usually the best
way of learning, provided you remember that a little bit of education goes a
long way to make the whole thing much more safe.

Here on this blog we will be semi-regularly posting with our projects and
experiments where we want to try something, or learn something, and see what
happens.

Our scientific method will be very simple:

* Research a bit to see if it's dangerous
* Forscience it if it's not

Sometimes we will post a video with our blog posts so look out for those as
well! â˜º

And we look forward to hearing about questions you might want answered. Let us
know if you want us to forscience something for you!
