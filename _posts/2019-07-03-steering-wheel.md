Hello forsciencers!

We have travelled the country and trawled the internet trying to find a cover
for Jen's steering wheel, and to no avail, for Jen's steering wheel is ever so
slightly bigger than the usual size, and nobody seems to make one large enough
any more.

<!-- cut -->

Had they even, we expect we would have paid above the odds for it anyway.

But then we thought, what if we got a small one and just sort of... cut it? What
would happen? How would we secure it? What's inside these things anyway?

So, we bought a Â£10 cover from Halfords and decided to try lacing it on by
making holes and reinforcing them with metal eyelets.

Check out the video:

I guess we learned some lessons from this. Next time, we'll do a few things
differently.

* Use longer eyelets!
* It would probably make sense to put the eyelets in *before* cutting. This
  would ensure the whole lot stays in one piece instead of getting all
  misaligned.
* There's probably a better way of cutting it, too. Something neater that we can
  do in one chop.
* I think we'll need higher-quality shoelaces because these ones seem flimsy.

Now, the reason we wanted this in the first place is because we bought a
steering wheel knob for Jen, since a lot of the time she's not strong enough to
grip the wheel enough to turn it.

Trouble is, it doesn't go small enough! So we have a steering wheel that is too
big and too small at the same time. By padding it with a cover, we can fit the
knob to the wheel properly...

So then I thought, why don't we just chop a section out of the cover and attach
the knob to that?

So I did.

Hope you enjoyed this episode of forscience! Come back next time and we'll see
what we can ruin next.
